In addition to having artistic skills, I have had direct contact with computing since the 1980s, using it professionally since 1993. In 1998, I started my studies in computer graphics and, in the late 1990s, in programming, especially for Web and Multimedia. Since 2007, I have been working with Digital Signage, and although I have created games before, it was in 2010 that I deepened my studies in this area to advance my knowledge in multimedia and programming."
